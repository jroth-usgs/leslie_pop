# leslie_pop
A python implementation of a common Leslie matrix population model

1.) Reads in a .pop file containing fecundity and survival rates for population age classes.

2.) Reads in a .str file containing stress period and survival reduction rates for age classes.

3.) Performs transient and steady state population simulations based on inputs

4.) Produces plots and statistics of populations over time

Future Development:

1.) Include density dependance

2.) Incorporate spatial components

3.) Make GUI
